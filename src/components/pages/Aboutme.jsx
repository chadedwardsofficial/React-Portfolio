      Hey there! I'm Chad and I am a Junior Software Developer based in Dallas. I am a caffeine addicted lover of traveling, foreign films and anthropology! You can find me on weekdays  coding and on weekends exploring the city's hidden gems. I'm all about finding that sweet spot between lines of code and discovering what makes each place unique.

        <p> Later in my life I have a newfound passion for coding and all things tech! I am a recent graduate from Southern Methodist University with a Full Stack Web Development Certificate! I have a pet cat named Miso and fun-fact: she is the ghost writer for all of my code! </p>
